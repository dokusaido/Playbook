## DevOps Kaizen

**Kaizen** is a Japanese word that translates to "**change for better**", and that Kaizen involves a process of **continuous improvement** undertaken by teams which can cross organizational boundaries when necessary. Kaizen aims to improve customer/client outcomes by eliminating waste and making organizations leaner by incrementally improving and standardizing processes along the entire value stream.

**DevOps Kaizen** is a process which uses DevOps tools, technologies and methodologies to continuously improve the flow of work through the E2E value stream to achieve better customer outcomes. The aim of the Kaizen events is to have the team focus on improving flow and processes incrementally.

The 3 ways of DevOps:
- The First Way emphasizes the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department.
- The Second Way is about creating the right to left feedback loops. The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.
- The Third Way is about creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.

Kaizen is composed of seven core principles:
- Good processes bring good results.
- Go see for yourself to grasp the current situation.
- Speak with data, manage by facts.
- Take action to contain and correct root causes of problems.
- Work as a team.
- Kaizen is everybody’s business.
- Make small changes over time.

Continuous improvement would become part of daily work, that it becomes second nature to us in all stages of our development cycle including architecture, planning, development, testing, security, deployment and operability.

To start a DevOps Kaizen event you need to understand the current state and [[Value Stream Mapping|VSM]] provides that. VSM is used to map current state while DevOps Kaizen drives continuous improvements in a process using DevOps tools and processes.
