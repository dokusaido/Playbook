## DevSecOps

Traditionally DevOps focuses on tools, but it is important to emphasize the importance of mindset and culture. While tools are definitely an important aspect, being easier to implement and more visible, they actually have a lower impact in the long run. Implementing certain principles and practices will make a more significant difference, even though it will not be immediately recognizable.

Trying to implement DevSecOps by _only_ enforcing the use of certain tools without the understanding of its core principles, would provide suboptimal results, at best. One of the top critical success factors of successful DevOps adoption is managers and leaders internalizing and buying into DevSecOps culture and principles.

The benefits of Mindset/Culture changes vs. focus on tools include:

- DevSecOps is purposely implemented without boundaries, so that it can keep incorporating new concepts and leveraging other fields and bodies of knowledge. It contradicts silos and embodies the concept of standing on the shoulders of giants
- With DevSecOps, security is integrated into the development process. The development team owns security along with all quality attributes. Security use cases are included from the beginning and security tests are executed every time code is checked in. Developers should not wait until a later phase of a software lifecycle to test for security.
- Through the use of a CI/CD pipeline there is a record of all changes, tests, reviews, and approvals. From a security perspective, it is well documented (within the process) exactly what changed and by whom.

A core DevSecOps practice is to release small batches frequently. As the size of each release becomes smaller, so does the risk of missing a security issue. It becomes easier to test for security and if there is an issue, also to identify where the vulnerability is, to back out the change and to fix the problem.

Another core DevSecOps principle is to shift-left all testing and validation. The DevOps best practice for security is to move security testing as early as possible in the development lifecycle and as close as possible to when changes are made. Not only is this faster and less expensive, but it is a much more reliable way to identify and remedy potential security issues and not letting vulnerabilities slip through to production.

Using common DevSecOps practices enables the team (dev, ops, support, security) to know exactly what production artefact is associated with what specific change.

The DevSecOps journey creates a more unified approach between development and security teams. Security can remain an independent function even as Dev and Ops come together, but this does not represent the optimal state. Integrating application security unites the product team to be more efficient, and requires that all team members participate in the securing of applications.
